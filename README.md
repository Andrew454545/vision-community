# VISION Community

Anonymous, contribution-gated visual search. Volunteers process locations.
The service stores **panorama metadata and embeddings only**, then outputs
**map-making.app JSON**. Street View imagery is not saved. Open the downloaded
JSON on map-making.app to view the locations.

Each verified scene location earns 1 unit. Each verified object location earns
10 units. **Every search costs exactly 100,000 units.** New accounts start at
zero. The owner uses the same index and the same gate as everyone else.

## What works locally

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s community/tests -v
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m community.measure
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m community.server --metadata
```

`--metadata` loads a panorama-ID catalog (pose only). `--visual` is an invented
descriptor self-test. `--demo` is the old fixture/label prototype and must not
be shipped as the product.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. Create an anonymous account, process a batch, then
search by uploading a map-making.app JSON (the same `customCoordinates` format
the local VISION app exports). Download the result JSON and open it on
map-making.app.

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m community.admin check --db community/.data/demo.sqlite
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m community.admin backup --db community/.data/demo.sqlite --to /tmp/vision-community-backup.sqlite
```

## Storage at 200 million locations

A 200M corpus of community embeddings plus pano/pose metadata is about 33 GiB
(~$0.34/month on R2 after the free 10 GB). VISION-scale 3,080-byte embeddings
at 200M are about 590 GiB (~$9/month storage). Neither stores imagery. Fast
search still needs a dedicated host; Workers Free cannot scan 200M vectors.
See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and [MEASUREMENTS.md](MEASUREMENTS.md).

## Invariants

- Canonical pano ID, capture, lane, and model have one queue row.
- Expired leases are fenced; stale, forged, duplicate, and replayed work does
  not credit.
- Imagery bytes and tile URLs are rejected. Only metadata and embeddings persist.
- Search debit and JSON emission happen in trusted server code.
